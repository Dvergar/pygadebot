# Pygadebot

Pygadebot is a simple python irc bot which regularly sends tweets on a channel from a customized twitter search.

## Tutorial
* Make a search on twitter, let's say you searched for "super noodles", you'll get that url `https://twitter.com/#!/search/super%20noodles`.

* Catch everything after `search/` here it's `super%20noodles`.
* Put that at the end of : `http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=` so that we have `http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=super%20noodles` : this is the json version of that search.

* Replace `url_search` line 9 with that new url.
